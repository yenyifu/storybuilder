# Story Builder - Writing Editor Requirements

## Overview

The story-builder writing editor is designed to provide a seamless, age-appropriate writing experience for children, inspired by ChatGPT's editor mode. The editor supports two distinct interaction modes with smooth transitions between them.

## Two Modes of Interaction

### 1. Full Editor View

- **Purpose**: Distraction-free writing environment for drafting and editing the entire story
- **Features**:
  - Scrollable, full-screen writing area
  - Large, readable text with high line-height
  - Inline formatting tools
  - Autosave functionality
  - Read-aloud capabilities

### 2. Chat View

- **Purpose**: AI-assisted story development through conversation
- **Features**:
  - Collapsed editor (minimized or hidden)
  - Chat interface as primary interaction method
  - Full story displayed as context component within chat thread
  - AI provides age-appropriate prompts for story expansion and refinement

## User Flow

1. **Initial State**: Child begins in Full Editor View for story drafting
2. **Progression**: Transitions to Chat View for AI-assisted development
3. **Iteration**: Can toggle between modes as needed throughout the writing process

## Editor Requirements

## UI State Transitions

### Editor Open → Chat View
